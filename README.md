# MSC — Archimedean Core (Symbolic Resilience Module)

This repository implements the **Archimedean Core (Mode 6)** of the *Module of Symbolic Coherence (MSC)*, based on the symbolic architecture proposed in the *Theory of the Board (TT)*.

## Description

Two symbolic agents are simulated:

- **ΨEidon**: Equipped with Mode 6, capable of symbolic recovery during entropic collapse.
- **ΨOrphos**: Without Mode 6, susceptible to irreversible symbolic failure.

These agents interact in a custom `gymnasium` environment where symbolic entropy (`H_C(x)`) and structural deformation (`Δ(t)`) evolve dynamically.

## Features

- Reproducible simulations with entropy tracking
- Crisis-response behavior modeling
- Visual comparison of symbolic survivability

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

```bash
python simulation_core.py
```
