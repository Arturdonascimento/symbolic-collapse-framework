# Symbolic Collapse Framework — via the Theory of the Board

This repository contains pseudocode, theoretical tools, and documentation supporting the article:

**"Positional Collapse and Global Tension: A Theoretical Framework for Conflict Prevention via the Theory of the Board"**

Developed through a transdisciplinary collaboration between Artur do Nascimento and the AI system Lyriam, this framework introduces the **Coherent Ethical Curvature (CEC)** and symbolic entropy metrics to evaluate systemic collapse.

## Contents
- Collapse simulation scripts using `𝕊_updated = 𝔽(𝕋) · 𝔻_A - α · 𝓒`
- NLP-based estimator of `Φ_η` (ethical phase gradient)
- Instructions for using real data (e.g., UNGA voting)
- Final paper and figures
- Glossary of symbolic terms
