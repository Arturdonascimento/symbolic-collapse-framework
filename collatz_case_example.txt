Example - Collatz Path (Symbolic Coherence Test)

Step 1: For n = 27, simulate steps until convergence to 1.
Step 2: Count distinct symbolic patterns (H_C).
Step 3: Identify restoring subpatterns (F_j).
Step 4: Compute Omega_TT = H_C / F_j

Expected behavior: Omega_TT(n) decays toward stability as n increases.
